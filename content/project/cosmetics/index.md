Each night, in the role of Scheherazade, players must tell a tale to the Sasanian King to delay their execution. The king takes turns to continue the story. Scheherazade can turn certain words like "sword", "knife", or "shield" into physical objects, aiding in the battle against the king. Victory means freedom for herself and the other characters.

This game is a testament to the power of machine learning in expanding the creative horizons of video games. '1001 Nights' is built on the framework of the classic Arabian Nights, offering a labyrinth of stories within stories, powered by a text-generation algorithm that adapts to the player's narrative input.
